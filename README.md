# TV Last
TV Last is an Amazon Alexa skill that returns information about the last aired episode for a given TV series.

To invoke the skill ask, "Alexa, ask TV Last what was the last episode for How I Met Your Mother?"

This skill uses the [TV Maze API](http://api.tvmaze.com/) and standard Python libraries. `skill.py` runs on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and provides the backend support for the skill invoked by Alexa.

It will be expanded in the future.  If you have feature suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out to [@kkoppenhaver on Twitter](https://twitter.com/kkoppenhaver) or [via email](mailto:k.koppenhaver@gmail.com)
